# BONES

A core of Godot addons for rapid prototyping.

Mostly addons built alongside games like [Dot
Hop](https://github.com/russmatney/dothop) and
[Dino](https://github.com/russmatney/dino), but also stretched into prototypes
like [Blox](https://github.com/russmatney/blox),
[Overculted](https://github.com/moonstorm-clerics/overculted-prototype), and
[Terrorware](https://github.com/moonstorm-clerics/terrorware-prototype).

## Background

[Dino](https://github.com/russmatney/dino) was originally a games 'monorepo' - I
built games for many jams in the same project, sometimes reusing patterns, other times
trying out new things. (I made youtube devlog about this here:
[Dino Year One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cyAnNLGrZI))

Eventually I refactored that, smashing the parts of those games into a single
steam release (which admittedly needs a bunch more work, but we'll get back to
it later). Since then, I've picked and pulled from it whenever I start a new
project.

Bones is a place to manage the addons that Dino is built on, with an angle
toward jam games and rapid prototyping. Once you start getting serious about
your own game (i.e. more than prototyping), you'll probably start writing
systems that are specific to that game.

I want to pull over the patterns and the code, but leave most of the assets
(or maybe leave some placeholders in place for help getting started.)
