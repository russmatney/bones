# BONES

A core of Godot addons for rapid prototyping.

Mostly addons built alongside games like Dot Hop and Dino, but also stretched
into prototypes like Blox and Terrorware.

## Background

Dino was originally a games 'monorepo' - I built for many jams in the same
project, sometimes reusing patterns, other times trying out new things.

Eventually I refactored that, smashing the parts of those games into a single
steam release. Since then, I've picked and pulled from it whenever I start a new
project.

Bones is a place to manage the addons that Dino is built on, with an angle
toward jam games and rapid prototyping.

I want to pull over the patterns and the code, but leave most of the assets
(or maybe leave some placeholders in place for help getting started.)
